# Goblo The Harvester
Here is Goblo! He can do not a lot of things - beat things, get beaten by thing, spit and grab everything he sees.

Goblo is the best harvester in the name of the dark lord, who occupies the castle in the clouds.

Recently, his army of the damned went riot and now Goblo has to bring their souls back!

More souls, phylacteries and gold for the lord!

Go through all the levels and collect all stuff, then the lord will honor you with a personal audience.
